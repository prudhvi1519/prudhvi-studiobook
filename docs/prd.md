# Cinematic Scrollytelling Portfolio - PRD Summary

## Vision
A single-page, cinematic portfolio with immersive scrollytelling, bento grid layouts, and high-end motion design.

## Core Requirements
- **Single Page + Overlay**: No multi-page routing except for specific case study deep links.
- **Cinematic Aesthetics**: Dark matte theme (#0B0C0F), noise textures, elegant typography.
- **Recruiter Mode**: Toggle to disable high-end motion for quick scanning.
- **Performance**: Reduced motion support, optimized assets.

## Implementation Phases

2. **Motion Foundation**: GSAP integration, scroll pinning, basic transitions.
3. **Case Study Deep Dive**: FLIP animations, full content overlay.
4. **Polish**: Micro-interactions, hover states, loading skeletons.
5. **Content ecosystem**: Real project data, assets, SEO.
6. **Ship**: Vercel deployment, final QA.
